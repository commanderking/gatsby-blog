description: How does Season 10's judge selection stack up to what it could have been? Was Diamond Zhang the best choice for helper coach for Sister Na? 
---

In the first episode of season ten, the [judges' performances](https://youtu.be/tnsCWtmhGq0?t=489) paid tribute to the many previous seasons' judges, including the likes of Jay Chou, Nick, Li Jian, and Liu Huan. Wanting to highlight the impact voice of China has made over its ten year run, the producers likely tried to bring back some of the most popular judges through its many seasons. How well did they do? Here's my semi-serious, mostly facetious analysis of how the producers did with their judge selection.



### Sister Na

#### Rating: A+

The only must have judge for season ten, Sister Na has been a judge for six of the ten seasons, winning three of them. After [rumored discontent](https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/na-ying-quits-as-sing-china-mentor) between Na and the show's producers, Na's return may not have been guaranteed, but looks like the producers have now made amends or paid a salary so extravagant that Na could not resist. Whatever the process, it was the right and necessary move. 

Na's history and success on the show speaks for itself. She's often the central character of many of the judge interactions, and has consistently been great on the show, both in terms of banter and coaching.

A necessary, but ultimately, fantastic fantastic choice. 

### Wang Feng

#### Rating: A

Coach for four seasons (2,3,4, and 5) and one time winner (Jiang Dunhao), Wang Feng has been the second longest tenured coach for VOC. Wang Feng's time has completely overlapped with Sister Na's, and the rapport they developed during their four years will likely bring back the lively banter that's been absent in the past few seasons. Throughout their time, Wang has served as the perfect foil to Na - rock vs ballad, stoic vs excitable, boy vs girl, single time winner vs multiyear winner - the list goes on and on. 

Great choice! 

### Li RongHao

#### Rating: B

The difficulty in finding a VOC gif with only Li RongHao bodes poorly for the selection, but the two time judge and one time winner (Xing Hanming) is the only judge who has been on the show for the past two seasons. This continuity cannot be overlooked, but Li RongHao has never been one of the more vocal coaches during the competition. His return also certainly guarantees the return of more small eye jokes from his fellow judges. Maybe these jokes actually poll well with the Chinese audience?! 

With the introduction of original song performances from last season, Li also is a good choice given his experience of composing. Li checks off all the practical boxes, though it's hard to be enthusiastic about his return, though perhaps that speaks to the quality of the other judges that have been on the show. 

Fine choice.

### Hacken Lee

#### Rating: B+

It's a bit puzzling that the production team wasn't able to bring back all former judges for the tenth season, but perhaps they tried and failed, or perhaps they actually wanted to bring a fresh face to the scene. Most of the more recent versions of VOC have featured at least one Cantonese singer (Nick or Eason), so Hacken fits a need here. His consistency across over four decades and recent appearance on [I Am a Singer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHdfUckpyL8) has likely buoyed his popularity and will draw a certain audience. 

Also unlike co-judge Wang Feng, who has been plagued by rumors of infidelity, Hacken's reputation is clean as a whistle. A fresh judge also gives Wang and Na a target for bullying, but it's hard to imagine being successful bullying a guy as clean cut as Hacken.

Solid choice. 


### Overall Rating: A-

Sister Na with any combination of previous judges likely already baselines the rating at B, but the addition of long time VOC buddy, Wang Feng, pushes the team to B+/A- territory. Li and Hacken will both be fine, with Hacken's experience as host of I Am a Singer potentially bringing significant upside for the group banter. 

An A+ team likely would have been Na, Wang, Jay Chou, and Harlem harkening back to the glory days of Season 4 and 5. An equally good one might have been three of the above with the addition of Season 2 winner and the [ultimate party girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFHb0OwmE-0), A-mei. But alas, perhaps we need to wait until season 11 to see a judging cast that is at least 50% women.
